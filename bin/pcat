""" pcat

First version by Daniele Trifirò on 2013-08-17.
brethil@phy.olemiss.edu

Run with -h or --help for usage.

This is a wrapper the the other functions in the package.

PCAT Pipeline:
	1) Retrieve data 
		Read from the frame files (and save if requested) time series
		for the given time interval.
		
		Uses retrieve_timeseries() from `pcat.utils`
		
	2) Condition data 
		a conditioning_function() is defined based on the required
		processing, and data is prepared for analysis by calling
		conditioning_function().
		Uses various functions from `pcat.condition`
		
		Data conditioning and retriveval is sped up by launching multiple
		processes, defined by the PARALLEL_PROCESSES variable (see below).
		
	3) Create database
		Create a database from the previously processed data.
		
		Uses create_data_matrix(...), create_data_matrix_from_psd(...)
		from `pcat.utils`.
		
	4) Perform PCA
		Perform PCA on the database
		PCA(...) from `pcat.pca`
		
	5) Cluster the scores matrix from `pcat.pca`
		gaussian_mixture(...) from `pcat.gmm`
		
		Other clustering algorithms can be easily implemented
		by changing gaussian_mixture() with another function.
		For more see `pcat.gmm`
	
	6) Plot scatterplots (with image maps), time series
		scatterplot(...), spike_time_series(...), plot_psds(...)
		from `pcat.gmm`
	
	7) Print URL to analysis results.
